# Job Application Agent

An AI agent that does the whole job-application loop: discovers open roles,
tailors your resume per job description, generates a PDF, and fills out the
ATS application form (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, ...) — dropdowns, comboboxes,
and the "why do you want to work here" boxes included. Then it **stops and
waits for you to review and click Submit.** It never submits on its own.

## What it does

- **Discovers** open roles across job boards (`discover.py`, `yc_discover.py`)
- **Tailors** your resume to each job description and generates a fresh PDF
  (`tailor.py`, `gen_pdf.py`, `make_cv.py`)
- **Fills** the actual application in its own browser window — so your main
  browser stays free, unlike extension-based autofill (`main.py`)
- **Pauses for human review** before every submit — it's an assistant, not a
  spam cannon
- **Survives crashes**: queue processing picks up where it left off
- **Follows up**: drafts follow-up emails for submitted applications (`followup.py`)

## How it works

1. `profile.yaml` holds your facts + voice notes (single source of truth)
2. Playwright opens the job URL in a dedicated Chromium with a persistent
   profile (logins/cookies survive between runs)
3. The form is extracted from the DOM; an LLM maps every field to an answer —
   profile facts verbatim, open-ended questions drafted in your voice,
   unknowns skipped
4. The agent fills the form, then **pauses — you review and click Submit
   yourself**

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
# create profile.yaml with your details (name, contact, work history, voice notes)
export LLM_API_KEY=...         # + optional LLM_BASE_URL / LLM_MODEL / LLM_REASONING_EFFORT
```

## Run

```bash
python main.py https://boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/12345
python main.py --queue jobs.txt    # one URL per line
./apply.sh                          # full pipeline via launcher script
```

## Notes

- Quality over volume: review every application before submit
- Don't point this at LinkedIn Easy Apply (ToS) or CAPTCHA-walled flows
- Workday: log in once in the agent's browser window; the persistent profile
  remembers
- Browser profiles, resumes, and application data are gitignored — keep it
  that way; they contain session cookies and personal info
